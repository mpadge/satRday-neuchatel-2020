# Presentation for SatRdays (remote) Neuchatel, 14 March 2020

[Click here if ya just wanna get to the
stuff.](https://mpadge.github.io/satRday-neuchatel-2020).
Alternatively, if you're interested in the *how*, here's that stuff:

1. Clone the repo
2. `make`
3. `make open`

The first `make` should recreate all data used in the presentation, which may
take a while. After that, subsequent `make`s will be effectively instantaneous.
